# ðŸ’»Conversion of Traditional ModelsðŸ’»

Here is a walkthrough in how the conversion of the traditional machine learning models created by most common frame works such as  to ONNX format.

## 1. Conversion of Tensorflow Models to ONNX


## 3. Conversion of Scikit-learn Models

ONNX was initially designed for neural networks and deep learning models. 
However, ONNX has evolved to support ðŸ”„ other types of models beyond neural networks, making it more versatile and suitable for various machine learning tasks. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡

### Here is example of simple **Linear Regression:**
---
```python
import onnxmltools
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create and train a Scikit-learn Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
# (Assume X_train and y_train are the input features and labels)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Convert the Scikit-learn model to ONNX format
onnx_model = onnxmltools.convert_sklearn(model, initial_types=[('input', 'float32', X_train.shape[1])])
onnx_model_path = "linear_regression.onnx"
onnxmltools.utils.save_model(onnx_model, onnx_model_path)
```
